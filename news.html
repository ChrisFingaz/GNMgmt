							And I'm glad to see that. But we shouldn't use our humility as an excuse for inaction. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach. I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. This history is well known..

							They know we can do better. But I also get the sense that there's a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any single cause or issue. And it's a lesson we need to remember today - as members of another Joshua generation. Our government should work for us, not against us. I do not believe that women must make the same choices as men in order to be equal, and I respect those women who choose to live their lives in traditional roles.

							Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. For the men and women of Reverend Wright's generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.
